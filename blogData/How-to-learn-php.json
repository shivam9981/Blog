Entries may be edited by anyone! You are reading the English version of this multilingual dictionary of all languages, in which all words of all languages are explained in English, in a descriptivist (not prescriptivist) way. In the left sidebar, you will find links to other language versions of Wiktionary, in which the definitions are presented in other languages; each Wiktionary has a language code in its URL that designates which language it uses for its explanations. Designed as the lexical companion to Wikipedia, the encyclopedia project, Wiktionary has grown beyond a standard dictionary and now includes a thesaurus, a rhyme guide, phrase books, language statistics and extensive appendices. We aim to include not only the definition of a word, but also enough information to really understand it. Thus, etymologies, pronunciations, sample quotations, synonyms, antonyms, translations, spelling variants, non-standard spellings, etc., are included. Wiktionary is a wiki, which means that you can edit it, and all the content is dual-licensed under both the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License and the GNU Free Documentation License. Before you contribute, you may wish to read through some of our Help pages, and bear in mind that we do things quite differently from other wikis. In particular, we have strict layout conventions and inclusion criteria. Learn how to start a page, how to edit entries, experiment in the sandbox and visit our Community Portal to see how you can participate in the development of Wiktionary. We have created 7,274,978 entries since starting in December 2002, and we’re still growing.Hello, and welcome!
